# nextjs-food-app-demo

A demo project of a fictitious restaurant built in the Next.js framework using React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, SQLite, and other modern web development technologies.

Please note that this project includes a backend applicaiton that must be running for the menu items data to be accessible to the front-end applicaiton.

## Back-End Application.

First, run the development server:

- In a terminal window, cd into the backend folder.
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

Open [http://localhost:8080/menu-items](http://localhost:8080/menu-items) with your browser to see the menu items data stored within the SQLite database.

## Front-End Application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, open a seperate terminal window (2 are needed for running FE and BE applicaitons)

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
